# CourseDocs
Templates and code documents for the AI and Neurscience course I will be teaching from October through Decmber.

## Required Templates

### What is AI?
Example documents required, including live demonstration programs, and a bunch of nice looking data.

### Introduction to Programming
Worksheet required, and solutions code blocks should be provided, but nothing difficult. Should do some simple stuff like printing all times tables, FizzBuzz, etc...

### Introduction to Data
Worksheet needed for this one too, as well as some data files. We'll do a bubble sort and binary search, and cover importing data into Colab. We'll do character counting or something too.

### Abstraction
Example needed to demonstrate breaking down a corpus into individual tokens and using the top-k words to make a basic categorisation system. Need worksheet instruction on hwo students can implement this too.

### Construction
Demonstration of NGram needed as well as worksheet.

### Evolutionary Psychology
Genetic Algorithm exampl eneeded to demonstrate some comb.opp. problem being solved. We'll get students to do the Knappsack problem, so we'll need to provide a worksheet and a dataset of a very difficult problem.

### Where Evolution Fails
Need a demonstration of simulated annealing. Worksheet needed as a continuation of the last one.

### Thinking like a human
Example of this using the slide puzzle (already have this written somewhere) and I can throw together a really simple chess engine to allow them to make a minimax.

### Faster Computation
Alpha-Beta pruning. This mimicks a human process where we just ignore options that don't look good for us. Need to make a worksheet and live example.

### Neural Networks
I have enough neural networks written to be able to find a good demonstration to put here. I'll need to make a worksheet for making a network to solve an AND and an OR gate.

### MLP
Same as above, but we'll use an MLP to do a XOR gate and a full adder. Need worksheets for these.
